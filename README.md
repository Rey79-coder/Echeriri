PROPOSAL GOAL

    Develop a brand awareness site for an upcoming soap company Echeriri. The site is meant to display their collection (EARTH, WATER, FIRE, and WIND). To add further functionality to the site, we included a section
    where users can utilize Wikipedia to research more information about the brandâ€™s origin and name.

    Users are encouraged to research ingredients and are provided a comment box below to write down collections and ingredients that interest them. To further increase engagement and emotional ties to the brand we are encouraging users to also save a GIF to provide an emotional reminder of their interest in the product.

APIs We wish to use:

-Wikipedia / DVL REYNA
-Giphy / DVL CHAD

Ways we will implement client storage:
We will use local storage to save user input for
their later personal usage.
