PROPOSAL GOAL

    Develop a brand awareness site for an upcoming soap company Echeriri. The site displays its collection (EARTH, WATER, FIRE, and WIND). 
    To add functionality to the site, we included a section where users can connect to Wikipedia server to research more information about natural ingredients.

    Users are encouraged to save ingredients. A comment box is provided for users to save ingredients that interest them. 
    
    Finally, to increase engagement and emotional ties to the brand we are encouraging users to remember with a GIF to provide an emotional reminder of their interest in the product.

APIs We wish to use:

-Wikipedia / DVL REYNA
-Giphy / DVL CHAD

Ways we will implement client storage:
We will use local storage to save user input for
their later personal usage.
